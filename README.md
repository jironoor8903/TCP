The goal of this project is to implement a Socket that implements a TCP protocol similar to those you can find in the Internet. A socket is an abstraction between the application layer and the transport layer that allows an application to easily use the underlying transport protocol (TCP in this case). While sockets are usually implemented by the operating system, your socket will be a user space implementation written in Python. In this project, I will be implementing core parts of the protocol, and the tests we provide will act as applications. These applications will use the Socket class you write and expect the behavior defined in the specification.
